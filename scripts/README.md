# Football-stats

## Synopsis

The purpose of the project is to retrieve odd dropping data and to analyze it via mongo DB. Different analyzation tools will be further added. At the end of the project, we expect followed points to be covered:
- trying to make this "a big data" project
- trying to find relation between odd dropping and final result of football matches

## Motivation

The project was inspired by the idea that we can:
- find a correlation between odd dropping and final result of matches
- increase personal skills in nodejs, mongo DB, big data at all...
